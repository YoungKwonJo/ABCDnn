# ABCDnn - Background shape estimation using DNN
Author: Suyong Choi (Korea University, Department of Physics)

We implement neural autoregressive flow for use in background shape estimation using various conditional variables. 
It can perform ABCD style extrapolation, but also more complicated estimations using multiple control regions.
